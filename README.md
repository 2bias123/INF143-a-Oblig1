## Task 1
To run the code in problem1.py you just have to make a call to the function named `write_to_file`, with the lfsr function and the desired file location as input. The output will then be presented in a file with the same name as you put in the function call. 

## Task 2
To run the code in problem2.py you have to make a call to the function named `write_output_to_file`, with the desired output location as the input. The output will then be saved in a file with the same name as defined in the input.

## Task 3
To run the code in problem3.py you have to first decide if you want to decrypt or encrypt. If you want to encrypt you have to make a call to the function `encrypt` with the file with the plaintext and the file with the key as paramaters. If you want to decrypt you make a call to the `decryption` function with the ciphertext file and key file as parameters.
